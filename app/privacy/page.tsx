          <h2>1. What we don't collect</h2>
          <p>Your raw bank/card statement file is never uploaded to our servers. Parsing and
             detection happen entirely in your browser using JavaScript. We have no access to
             the file itself at any point.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. What we do store</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Your email address and account credentials (via Supabase Auth)</li>
            <li>The <em>results</em> of a scan you choose to save — merchant names, amounts,
                and frequencies of detected recurring charges — not the original statement</li>
            <li>Payment records (amount, Razorpay payment ID, timestamp) — not your card or UPI details, which Razorpay handles directly</li>
            <li>Your remaining scan credit balance</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. How we use it</h2>
          <p>Solely to operate the service: authenticating you, tracking scan credits, showing
             your scan history, and processing payments.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>4. Third parties</h2>
          <p>We use Supabase for authentication and database hosting, and Razorpay for payment
             processing. Each has its own privacy policy governing data they process on our
             behalf.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>5. Data deletion</h2>
          <p>You can request deletion of your account and associated scan history at any time
             by contacting <a href={`mailto:${SUPPORT_EMAIL}`}>{SUPPORT_EMAIL}</a>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>6. Changes</h2>
          <p>We may update this policy from time to time; material changes will be reflected
             here with an updated date.</p>
