          This is a starting draft. Decide your actual refund window and conditions, then have
          this reviewed before going live — Razorpay requires a clear refund policy to be
          publicly visible before approving a merchant account.

          <h2>Digital product, used credits</h2>
          <p>Scan credits are a digital product delivered immediately on payment. Because of
             this, we generally don't offer refunds once a payment has successfully added
             credits to your account.</p>

                correction.</li>
            <li>If you were charged twice for the same purchase due to a technical error,
